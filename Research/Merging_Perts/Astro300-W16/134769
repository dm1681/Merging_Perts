Using Python, plot the following two parametric functions on the same
axes.

 * start with t = np.arange(1,100,0.01)

x = 10 * cos(2t)
y = 10 * sin(3t)

Plot x vs. y

and 

i = 11 * sin(t) * cos(2t)
j = 11 * cos(t) * sin(2t)

Plot i vs. j


Clue #1 - How many times do the two function intersect?

(Read the intections from left to right - increasing x-value).

Clue #2 - What is the value of y at the first intersection (nearest
          integer)?  You may want to zoom in.

Clue #3 - What is the value of x at the last intersection (nearest
          integer)?  You may want to zoom in.
